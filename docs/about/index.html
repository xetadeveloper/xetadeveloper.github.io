        <p>
          I'm very concerned with adhering to established standards but also not
          afraid to think out of the box to implement creative and performant
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm very enthusiastic about any opportunity to learn technology that
          will further my ability to create better performant and usable
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I create responsive web applications because I love giving the end
          users a flexible platform to be productive
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="detail-item">
        <h4 class="bold-text text-header">Tools I Use</h4>
        <p>
          I work mainly with the MERN stack both front and back end, though I
          prefer back end more, but I;m flexible to work on both sides.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work with Jekyll, bundling and transpiling tools such as Webpack and
          Babel. This site was also built with Jekyll.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have the knowledge of Java SE of which I obtained the Java SE 8 OCP
          certification in 2017.
